# SUPPORT-ARR
Online Discord community to support users of various media servers and their plugins/apps.

# DEVELOPERS
Submit an "Issue" here with your ARR/APP that you would like to be added to Support-Arr using the same GitHub account that owns the ARR/APP. Since you will receive management rights for your channel on the Support-Arr Discord, I need to verify you are the actual owner.
